All names come from PDB file format documentation (just a few exceptions). To understand how this code can be used, please refer to the ipython notebook "PyDB_tutorial.ipynb" file. Those who will be using this parser are familiar with Python programming, and this code can be used interactively very easily with ipython or ipython notebook (or jupyter).
